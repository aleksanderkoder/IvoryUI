 # Ivory UI
 A library for easy creation of efficient and beautiful graphical user interfaces for C++ applications. 



# Dev notes
- Set project properties to compile as lib instead of exe when library development is done.
- Set subsystem in project properties to none. 
- Remove Source.cpp when lib is done. This file is only used for testing while lib is under active development.
